[META TEXT] Song with diversity 0.8:
that is a good song 
 i hit the ground running each night 
 i hit the man 
 and all the pieces fall right into place 
 getting caught up in a moment 
 lipstick on your face 
 so it goes… 
 
 come here dressed in black now 
 so so so it goes 
 come here dressed in black now 
 so so so it goes 
 come with you 
 dont leave me i get it wrong 
 you are so gorgeous it makes me so mad 
 you make me so happy it turns back to sad 
 theres nothing i hate more than what i cant have 
 and you are so gorgeous it makes me so mad 
 you make me so happy it turns back to sad 
 theres nothing i hate more than what i cant have 
 and you are so gorgeous it makes me so mad 
 youre gorgeous 
 you say that youd take me hand 
 its all at my door 
 if you just keep the one who will change them to fall where you touch 
 
 everything will be alright if we just keep dancing like were
