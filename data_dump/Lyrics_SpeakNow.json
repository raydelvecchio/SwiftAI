(Hold on)\nWe're gonna make it now (Hold on)\nAnd I can see it\nYeah, yeah\nI can see it now (See it now)41Embed"

(No)\nI don't think you do, I don't think you do\nLet's hear the applause (Come on, come on)\nCome on, show me how much better you are\n(So much better, yeah?)\nSee you deserve some applause\n'Cause you're so much better\nShe took him faster than you could say \"Sabotage\"28Embed"

    "lyrics": "Speak Now [Liner Notes] LyricsPrologue'Speak now or forever hold your peace,' the words said by preachers at the end of wedding ceremonies all over the world, right before the vows. It's a last chance for protest, a moment that makes everyone's heart race, and a moment I've always been strangely fascinated by. So many fantasize about bursting into a church, saying what they'd kept inside for years like in the movies. In real life, it rarely happens.\n\nReal life is a funny thing, you know. In real life, saying the right thing at the right moment is beyond crucial. So crucial, in fact, the most of us start to hesitate, for fear of saying the wrong thing at the wrong time. But lately what I've begun to fear more than that is letting the moment pass without saying anything.\n\nI think most of us fear reaching the end of our life, and looking back regretting the moments we didn't speak up. When we didn't say 'I love you.' When we should've said 'I'm sorry.' When we didn't stand up for ourselves or someone who needed help.\n\nThese songs are made up of words I didn\u2019t say when the moment was right in front of me. These songs are open letters. Each is written with a specific person in mind, telling them what I meant to tell them in person. To the beautiful boy whose heart I broke in December. To my first love who I never thought would be my first heartbreak. To my band. To a mean man I used to be afraid of. To someone who made my world very dark for a while. To a girl who stole something of mine. To someone I forgive for what he said in front of the whole world.\nWords can break someone into a million pieces, but they can also put them back together. I hope you use yours for good, because the only words you\u2019ll regret more than the ones left unsaid are the ones you use to intentionally hurt someone.\n\nWhat you say might be too much for some people. Maybe it will come out all wrong and you\u2019ll stutter and you\u2019ll walk away embarrassed, wincing as you play it all back in your head. But I think the words you stop yourself from saying are the ones that will haunt you the longest.\nSo say it to them. Or say it to yourself in the mirror. Say it in a letter you\u2019ll never send or in a book millions might read someday. I think you deserve to look back on your life without a chorus of resounding voices saying \u2018I could\u2019ve, but it\u2019s too late now.\u2019\n\nThere is a time for silence. There is a time waiting your turn. But if you know how you feel, and you so clearly know what you need to say, you\u2019ll know it.\n\nI don't think you should wait. I think you should speak now.\n\nLove, Taylor\n\nPS: To all the boys who inspired this album, you should've known. ;)1. Mine\nHidden message: Toby\n2. Sparks Fly\nHidden message: Portland, Oregon\n3.
