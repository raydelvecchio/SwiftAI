I don't know what to think\"\nHe knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said\n\n[Chorus]\n\"Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone\nI love you, and that's all I really know\nI talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress\nIt's a love story, baby, just say 'Yes'\"\n\n[Outro]\nOh, oh, oh\nOh, oh, oh\n'Cause we were both young when I first saw you173Embed"

(Ha-ha)\n\n[Chorus]\nI can't help it if you look like an angel\nCan't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so\nCome feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you\nCan't help it if there's no one else\nMmm, I can't help myself\nIf you look like an angel\nCan't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so\nCome feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you\nCan't help it if there's no one else\nMmm, I can't help myself\n\n[Outro]\nMyself\nCan't help myself\nI can't help myself37Embed"

Please, tell me\n'Cause one second it was perfect\nNow you're halfway out the door\n[Chorus]\nAnd I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called\nAnd then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all\nAnd you flashback to when he said, \"Forever and always\"\nOh, and it rains in your bedroom\nEverything is wrong\nIt rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone\n'Cause I was there when you said, \"Forever and always\"\n\n[Verse 2]\nWas I out of line?\nDid I say something way too honest, made you run and hide\nLike a scared little boy?\nI looked into your eyes\nThought I knew you for a minute, now I'm not so sure\nSo here's to everything coming down to nothing\nHere's to silence that cuts me to the core\nWhere is this going?\nThought I knew for a minute, but I don't anymore\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called\nAnd then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all\nAnd you flashback to when he said, \"Forever and always\"\nOh, and it rains in your bedroom\nEverything is wrong\nIt rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone\n'Cause I was there when you said, \"Forever and always\"\nYou didn't mean it baby, I don't think so\n[Bridge]\nOh, back up, baby, back up\nDid you forget everything?\nBack up, baby, back up\nDid you forget everything?\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause it rains in your bedroom\nEverything is wrong\nIt rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone\n'Cause I was there when you said, \"Forever and always\"\nOh, I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called\nAnd then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all\nAnd you flashback to when we said, \"Forever and always\"\nAnd it rains in your bedroom\nEverything is wrong\nIt rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone\n'Cause I was there when you said, \"Forever and always\"\n\n[Outro]\nYou didn't mean it baby\nYou said, \"Forever and always\", yeah14Embed"

    "lyrics": "Fearless [Liner Notes] LyricsTaylor's Letter\nThis album is called \"Fearless\", and I guess I'd like to clarify why we chose that as the title. To me, \"Fearless\" is not the absence of fear. It's not being completely unafraid. To me, fearless is having fears. Fearless is having doubts. Lots of them. To me, fearless is living in spite of those things that scare you to death. Fearless is falling madly in love again, even though you've been hurt before. Fearless is walking into your freshman year of high school at fifteen. Fearless is getting back up and fighting for what you want over and over again...even though every time you'e tried before, you've lost. It's fearless to have faith that someday things will change. Fearless is having the courage to say goodbye to someone who only hurts you, even if you can't breathe without them. I think it's fearless to fall for your best friend, even though he's in love with someone else. And when someone apologizes to you enough times for things they'll never stop doing, I think it's fearless to stop believing them. It's fearless to say \"you're NOT sorry\", and walk away. I think loving someone despite what people think is fearless. I think allowing yourself to cry on the bathroom floor is fearless. Letting go is fearless. Then, moving on and being alright...That's fearless too. But no matter what love throws at you, you have to believe in it. You have to believe in love stories and prince charmings and happily every after. That's why I write these songs. Because I think love is fearless\n\n\n1.
