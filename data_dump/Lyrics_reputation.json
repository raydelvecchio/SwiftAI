Lyrics[Verse 1]\nKnew he was a killer first time that I saw him\nWondered how many girls he had loved and left haunted\nBut if he's a ghost, then I can be a phantom\nHoldin' him for ransom, some\nSome boys are tryin' too hard, he don't try at all though\nYounger than my exes, but he act like such a man, so\nI see nothing better, I keep him forever\nLike a vendetta-ta\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI, I, I see how this is gon' go\nTouch me and you'll never be alone\nI-Island breeze and lights down low\nNo one has to know\n[Chorus]\nIn the middle of the night, in my dreams\nYou should see the things we do, baby\nIn the middle of the night, in my dreams\nI know I'm gonna be with you, so I take my time\nAre you ready for it?\n\n[Verse 2]\nKnew I was a robber first time that he saw me\nStealing hearts and running off and never sayin' sorry\nBut if I'm a thief, then he can join the heist, and\nWe'll move to an island, and\nAnd he can be my jailer, Burton to this Taylor\nEvery love I've known in comparison is a failure\nI forget their names now, I'm so very tame now\nNever be the same now, now\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI, I, I see how this is gon' go\nTouch me and you'll never be alone\nI-Island breeze and lights down low\nNo one has to know (No one has to know)\n\n[Chorus]\nIn the middle of the night, in my dreams\nYou should see the things we do, baby\nIn the middle of the night in my dreams\nI know I'm gonna be with you, so I take my time\nAre you ready for it?\nOh, are you ready for it?\n[Refrain]\nBaby, let the games begin\nLet the games begin\nLet the games begin\nBaby, let the games begin\nLet the games begin\nLet the games begin\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI, I, I see how this is gon' go\nTouch me and you'll never be alone\nI-Island breeze and lights down low\nNo one has to know\n\n[Chorus]\nIn the middle of the night (Night), in my dreams (My dreams)\nYou should see the things we do (We do), baby (Baby), hmm (Eh)\nIn the middle of the night, in my dreams (My dreams)\nI know I'm gonna be with you (I know I'm gonna be with you)\nSo I take my time\nIn the middle of the night\n\n[Refrain]\nBaby, let the games begin\nLet the games begin\nLet the games begin\nAre you ready for it?\nBaby, let the games begin\nLet the games begin\nLet the games begin\nAre you ready for it?155Embed"

(Oh)\n\n[Chorus]\nYou're so gorgeous\nI can't say anything to your face (To your face)\n'Cause look at your face (Look at your face, gorgeous)\nAnd I'm so furious (I'm so furious)\nAt you for making me feel this way (Feel this way)\nBut what can I say? (I say)\nYou're gorgeous\n[Outro]\nYou make me so happy it turns back to sad (Yeah)\nThere's nothing I hate more than what I can't have\nAnd you are so gorgeous it makes me so mad (Mmh)\nYou're gorgeous\nYou make me so happy it turns back to sad (It turns back to sad)\nThere's nothing I hate more than what I can't have (What I can\u2019t have)\nYou are so gorgeous it makes me so mad (Mmh)\nYou're gorgeous87Embed"

    "lyrics": "Reputation [Prologue] LyricsHere's something I've learned about people.\n\nWe think we know someone, but the truth is that we only know the version of them they have chosen to show us. We know our friend in a certain light, but we don't know them the way their lover does. Just the way their lover will never know them the same way that you do as their friend. Their mother knows them differently than their roommate, who knows them differently than their colleague. Their secret admirer looks at them and sees an elaborate sunset of brilliant color and dimension and spirit and pricelessness. And yet, a stranger will pass that person and see a faceless member of the crowd, nothing more. We may hear rumors about a person and believe those things to be true. We may one day meet that person and feel foolish for believing baseless gossip.\n\nThis is the first generation that will be able to look back on their entire life story documented in pictures on the internet, and together we will all discover the after-effects of that. Ultimately, we post photos online to curate what strangers think of us. But then we wake up, look in the mirror at our faces and see the cracks and scars and blemishes, and cringe. We hope someday we'll meet someone who will see that same morning face and instead see their future, their partner, their forever. Someone who will still choose us even when they see all of the sides of the story, all the angles of the kaleidoscope that is you.\n\nThe point being, despite our need to simplify and generalize absolutely everyone and everything in this life, humans are intrinsically impossible to simplify. We are never just good or just bad. We are mosaics of our worst selves and our best selves, our deepest secrets and our favorite stories to tell at a dinner party, existing somewhere between our well-lit profile photo and our drivers license shot. We are all a mixture of our selfishness and generosity, loyalty and self-preservation, pragmatism and impulsiveness. I've been in the public eye since I was 15 years old. On the beautiful, lovely side of that, I've been so lucky to make music for living and look out into crowds of loving, vibrant people. On the other side of the coin, my mistakes have been used against me, my heartbreaks have been used as entertainment, and my songwriting has been trivialized as 'oversharing'.\nWhen this album comes out, gossip blogs will scour the lyrics for the men they can attribute to each song, as if the inspiration for music is as simple and basic as a paternity test. There will be slideshows of photos backing up each incorrect theory, because it's 2017 and if you didn't see a picture of it, it couldn't have happened right?\n\nLet me say it again, louder for those in the back...\nWe think we know someone, but the truth is that we only know the version of them that they have chosen to show us.\n\nThere will be no further explanation.\nThere will be just reputation.14Embed"
